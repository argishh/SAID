# SAID
SAID, commonly known as Segregation Aid architecture, is a proposed solution to the problems revolving around waste segregation. SAID architecture segregates waste at the first step of waste management, that is waste collection. This eliminates the need to allocate additional resources to segregate waste at the waste collection center.
